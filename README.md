# Mapty3D

* 3D visualizer + simulator.
* Search feature available to search up a place and observe the condition in a particular region.
* Simulated drone available to navigatethe region that has been searched up using WASD keys.
* Simulates flood drainage systems and floods.
* User authentication to protect any sensitive data from malicious elements.
* Simulates natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes and their intensity.
* Offers an approximate representation of urban flooding.
* Critical sectors are marked red during times of crisis, based on the depth of the flood.
* Able to simulate disasters such as earthquakes when two parameters, namely magnitude and epicenter, are provided .
* Potential to be developed such that other disasters like landslides can be simulated.
